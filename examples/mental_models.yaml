# Example mental models configuration file
# This file demonstrates how to define custom mental models for GoThink

models:
  # High-priority custom model
  custom_problem_solving:
    name: "Custom Problem Solving Framework"
    description: "A comprehensive approach to solving complex problems"
    steps:
      - "Step 1: Define the problem clearly and specifically"
      - "Step 2: Gather all relevant information and data"
      - "Step 3: Identify constraints and limitations"
      - "Step 4: Generate multiple potential solutions"
      - "Step 5: Evaluate each solution against criteria"
      - "Step 6: Select the best solution and implement"
      - "Step 7: Monitor results and iterate if needed"
    category: "problem-solving"
    priority: 15

  # Medium-priority analytical model
  data_driven_analysis:
    name: "Data-Driven Analysis"
    description: "Systematic approach to analyzing data and drawing insights"
    steps:
      - "Step 1: Define the analysis objective"
