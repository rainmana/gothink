## Mental Models Contributions

### What Makes a Good Mental Model?

A good mental model should be:

- **Actionable**: Clear, step-by-step process that others can follow
- **Tested**: You've used it successfully in real situations
- **Original**: Either your creation or a significant improvement on existing models
- **Well-documented**: Clear description, examples, and use cases
- **Categorized**: Fits into one of our established categories

### Categories

We organize mental models into these categories:

- **üß† Analytical**: Problem analysis, data interpretation, systematic thinking
- **üéØ Decision-making**: Frameworks for making better decisions
- **üé® Creative**: Innovation, brainstorming, creative problem-solving
- **üßÆ Strategic**: Long-term planning, competitive analysis, business strategy
- **üß™ Scientific**: Evidence-based approaches, research methods, hypothesis testing
- **ü§ù Collaborative**: Team dynamics, communication, group decision-making
- **‚ö° Performance**: Productivity, optimization, efficiency
- **üåç Systems**: Complex systems thinking, interdependencies, emergent behavior

### Submission Format

When submitting a mental model, use this format:

```markdown
<div class="model-card">
  <h3>Your Model Name</h3>
  <p class="model-category">Category</p>
  <p class="model-author">by <a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">@yourusername</a></p>
  <p>Brief description of what this model does and when to use it.</p>
  <ul class="model-steps">
    <li>Step 1: Clear, actionable step</li>
    <li>Step 2: Another clear step</li>
    <li>Step 3: Continue with more steps</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="model-meta">
    <span class="model-tags">#tag1 #tag2 #tag3</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Example Submission

```markdown
<div class="model-card">
  <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
  <p class="model-category">Analytical</p>
  <p class="model-author">by <a href="https://github.com/johndoe" target="_blank">@johndoe</a></p>
  <p>Systematically identify the underlying causes of problems rather than just treating symptoms.</p>
  <ul class="model-steps">
    <li>Define the problem clearly and specifically</li>
    <li>Collect data and evidence about the problem</li>
    <li>Ask "why" five times to drill down to root causes</li>
    <li>Identify the fundamental root cause(s)</li>
    <li>Develop solutions that address root causes</li>
    <li>Implement and monitor the solutions</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="model-meta">
